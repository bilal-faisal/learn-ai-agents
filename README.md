# ðŸ¤– OpenAI Agents SDK â€” Experiments & Learning

This repository is a personal learning space where I explore, implement, and experiment with **agent-based architectures** using the [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python).

The goal is to build a collection of well-structured examples to deepen my understanding of agents, LLM orchestration, and runtime behaviors â€” and to share what I learn in a modular, clean way.
